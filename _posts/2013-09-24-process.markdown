## Getting Started
The internet can be a very large and scary place. It is the world's largest repository of information after all. Fear not, we are here. We've created this field guide to help give context to why we do what we do, and what we believe is the most efficient way of doing it. We've spent a lot of time learning the hard way so you don't have to. 

By following the guidelines outlined here, you can spend less time in the weeds and more time accomplishing the  important things in life. Maybe making the world a better place by creating kick-ass products that solve tangible problems and deliver true value to the people who use them? It's just an idea.
