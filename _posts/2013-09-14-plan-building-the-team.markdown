## Building The Team
This is a pretty self-explanatory item during the planning process, but there are some general guidelines we like to follow when thinking about team composition. They are:

1. Team members need to be excited about the product concept itself. 
2. Select team members who can bring dedicated focus. This means try not to allocate any single person to multiple projects. This is less efficient and results in decreased focused for the team member. 
3. Someone from each craft should be present during the broader planning meetings. An engineer, a designer, a product manager, and a stakeholder. This ensures all constraints are properly taken into consideration.
