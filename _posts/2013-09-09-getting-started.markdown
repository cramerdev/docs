## Purpose
Good products are the culmination of hundreds of good decisions. Waypoints is a collection of best practices that encompasses perspective from key crafts - product management, design, and engineering - to help you make good decisions at every point during the product development lifecycle. There are many alternative approaches out there, but the best practices captured in Waypoints represents the intentional choices we make as a team to be consistently successful at delivering high quality, valuable products to real people. 

This living guide changes as we grow and learn as a team, a company, and a community. It can serve as a resource for anyone who wants to learn more about how [Cramer Dev](http://cramerdev.com) approaches product development, but the primary goal is to create a broader open community around learning, discussing, developing, and implementing best practices for building high quality, interactive products. 

Waypoints is organized into 5 primary sections that embodies the repeatable iteration cycle we believe will yield the best results for developing a successful product:

1. Plan
2. Setup
3. Build
4. Launch
5. Analyze

Each section has several best practices the correlate to the phase your product is in. Best practices are organized by their objective, principles we follow, services and tools we use, our process, and additional learning resources. 

We welcome your involvement and feedback. You can participate by starting a discussion on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cramerdev/docs), forking the project and making changes, or emailing us at _waypoints [at] cramerdev.com_.
