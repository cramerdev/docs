<span class="highlight-engineers">Engineers to scope this out and drive the docs. The goal is to arrive at a consensus for the styles we want to follow in writing our code. Other important things to specify here could be stuff like best practices for documenting code (which we need to do a better job of). 
While I agree there will need to be some deviations from this depending on the specific needs of a project, adopting a standard set of tools will allow us more flexibility to jumping from project to projcet, and will make us much more efficient in collaborating together.
