## Objective
Some really intelligent overarching statement about our design process and capabilities

## Principles
Our work defines us. If we cut corners, then we will attract clients and projects that do the same. 

These design principles should guide everything we work on, small or large. 

We do not cut corners.

* Work as a team. Collaborate. We all contribute to design.
* Find the best solution. Research. Validate your assumptions. 
* Maintain a minimum level of quality. On all projects, regardless of size or deadline.
* Own the process. We are hired for our expertise, use it. 
* Be empathetic. Users are the focus of our efforts. Follow a User Centered Design process.
* Design around content and user goals. If you miss this, then nothing else matters.
* Rapid prototyping. Iterate early and often. Share your work.
* Educate. Collaborate with clients. Explain your decisions.
* Honest critiques. Don't hold back, push each other to become better.
* Pixel perfection. "Good enough" is simply not acceptable. 
* Embrace mobile first. Not as an option, rather the starting point.
* Simplify. When you are done, simplify some more.

Emphasizing design is a proven tactic in all lines of business -  successful projects and happy clients will propel us forward. Our products define not only our clients but our company.

## Our Process 
Iterative and collaborative - client and user feedback throughout

The same for web and app design - steps may be scaled, but should not be removed altogether

1. **Planning**
	- Initial Meeting (identify problems, goals and objectives, KPIs to track progress)
	- Requirements (assess needs)
	- Research (user profiles, devices, heuristic reviews: competitors and current site/app)
	- Solution Building (team discusses solutions)
	- *Present Proposal* (include reps from each discipline)

2. **Design**
	- Interaction Design (SIZE: sketch, wireframe, user flows, prototype)
	- User Testing
	- Content Development (site map, IA, content outline, writing)
	- Visual Design (SIZE: style tile, mood board, comps)

3. **Development**
	- Coding
	- Content Population
	- Cross Platform, Device and Browser Testing
	- QA (test and prod environments)
	- *Launch*

4. **Post Launch**
	- Training (SIZE: documentation, style guides, admin training)
	- Analyze (Progress on KPIs)
	- Technical Support
	- Refine (user test, iterate and improve)
