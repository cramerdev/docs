<span class="highlight-engineers">Engineers to scope this out and drive the docs. The goal is to arrive at a consensus for the tools we want to set as the "default" toolbox for accomplishing things like account management, admin interfaces, email delivery, hosting, monitoring, etc. Some clear sections i see are "server side languages and frameworks", "client side languages and frameworks", and maybe "scaling and infrastructure" but ultimately it's up to you!
While I agree there will need to be some deviations from this depending on the specific needs of a project, adopting a standard set of tools will allow us more flexibility to jumping from project to projcet, and will make us much more efficient in collaborating together.
